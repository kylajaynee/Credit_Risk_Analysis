# Credit_Risk_Analysis
### Module 18 Challenge
Machine learning


## Project Overview
Use skills in data preparation, statistical reasoning, and machine learning to apply machine learning to assess credit card risk. 


## Objectives
1. Use Resampling Models to Predict Credit Risk- using imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries, RandomOverSampling, SMOTE, and ClusterCentroids algorithms
2. Use the SMOTEENN Algorithm to Predict Credit Risk
3. Use Ensemble Classifiers to Predict Credit Risk


#### Results
